Every piece of data stored in a program is an object. <b>Each object has an identity, a type(also known as its class), 
and a value.</b> For example, when you write a = 42, an integer object is created with the value of 42. The identity of 
the object is a number representing its location in memory; <u>'a' is a label that refers to this specific location although
the label is not part of the object itself.</u>
